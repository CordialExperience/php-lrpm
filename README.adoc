= PHP-LRPM - PHP Long Running Process Manager

PHP-LRPM is a library for managing long running PHP processes.

== Motivation

Dynamic management of long running processes. Similar in function to process managers like daemontools or supervisord, but integrates with PHP code.

LRPM periodically reloads configuration from a custom source implemented in PHP (e.g. from a database), checks for changes in configuration and start/stop processes accordingly.

This https://youtu.be/MJkFHMOCEkg[talk by Giorgio Sironi] given at the Dutch PHP Conference in 2017 covers some of the problems and challenges when implementing long running PHP processes.

== Features

=== Simple

PHP-LRPM is built on top of POSIX process management facilities. PHP-LRPM starts its subprocesses via `fork(2)` and subprocesses donâ€™t daemonize.

=== Efficient

The operating system signals PHP-LRPM immediately when a process terminates. PHP-LRPM will in turn attempt to restart the terminated process.

=== Flexible

PHP-LRPM uses exponential backoff when attempting to restart a process; some process managers will try several times in quick succession and fail the process until operator intervention.

== Non-goals

Currently LRPM is not intended to run as PID 1, nor was it tested in this role.

== Usage

1. Implement the `ConfigurationSource`. This interface exposes a public method `loadConfiguration()`, that returns an associative array containing the configuration for all the workers (see details below).
2. Implement the `Worker`. This interface exposes two public methods, `start()` and `cycle()`. The child process will call `start()`, passing the worker configuration as an argument, and then enter an endless loop, where it calls `cycle()`, and then checks for a shutdown condition (usually, the death of the LRPM supervisor process). Backoff should be implemented by the cycle() method -- be carefult not to run a tight loop at times where cycles are not doing actual work!

=== Job configuration

Configuration is a simple associative array of jobs to run. Here's an example configuration consisting of a single job, with all the mandatory fields described in comments:

```
$config = [
    42 => [ // Unique job id (string or int)
        'name' => 'Job 42', // Descriptive name (string)
        'workerClass' => '\PHPLRPM\Test\MockWorker', // Class implementing the Worker interface (string)
        'mtime' => 1629121362, // Time when this job config was last modified, as UTC Unix timestamp (int)
        'workerConfig' => [] // Array of additional configuration specific to the Worker implementation (array)
    ]
]
```

Class `ConfigurationValidator` is used for config validation internally, and you can also use it to test your `ConfigurationSource` implementation.

If a job's `mtime` returned by the `ConfigurationSource` is newer than `mtime` from previous poll, that job will be restarted with the new configuration.

See `example.php` for a full running example with more details.

== Operating LRPM

It is recommended to run LRPM as a normal system service. Its main process stays in the foreground and logs to stdout and stderr.

Symlink the `lrpmctl` tool to somewhere in your PATH and use it to query the running instance for status, or to restart a process on demand.

== Development roadmap

=== Completed

==== Improve metadata handling

PHP-LRPM keeps metadata in an associative array. For efficient lookups by PID, a separate index is maintained.

This functionality was offloaded to a generic library https://github.com/vrza/array-with-secondary-keys[Array with Secondary Keys], that wraps a hash map and maintains secondary indexes (similar to how secondary keys in an SQL database work). In turn, building specific collection inspired building https://github.com/vrza/cardinal-collections[Cardinal Collections], a PHP toolkit for building collections.

==== Implement receiving, handling and responding to control messages

Included is the `lrpmctl` tool, which uses the https://github.com/vrza/php-tipc[tipc] library to exchange messages with a running instance of LRPM. Some examples of messages include getting the `status` of running processes (see screenshot above), and requesting a `restart` of a process.

=== TODO

==== Blocking shutdown

Wait for children after sending SIGTERM, follow up with SIGKILL if child doesn't respond to SIGTERM.

Implement blocking shutdown that waits for all children to exit.
